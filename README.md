# Repository of notes

This repository contains a collection of notes on various subjects, including software development, automation, and more. Each subject has its own directory, and within each directory you will find a number of markdown files containing notes on different topics within that subject.

To view the notes, simply navigate to the directory for the subject you are interested in and open the markdown files using a text editor or markdown viewer.

I hope you find these notes helpful, and please feel free to contribute any notes or corrections by opening a pull request.
